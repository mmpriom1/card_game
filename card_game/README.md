## About this App
This is a very simple incomplete Go app. As is, it will not run.

## Question 3
The goal for this application is to do the following:
* Generate a standard deck of cards
* Shuffle the deck
* Deal hands (of more than one card per hand) to at least 2 players
* Print out each player's hand of cards

The purpose of this question is to give you a playground to spend a bit of time with Go. Feel free to reorganize, rewrite or extend this application in any way you see fit. Have fun!
